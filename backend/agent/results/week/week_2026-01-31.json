    "reasoning": "Recent price drops (11-12% in a day), potential for tighter Fed policy, strengthening dollar, and speculation of reduced import duties. Some express belief in long-term bullishness due to global debt, monetary expansion, and role as a safe haven, but immediate sentiment is negative due to sharp sell-off and reported value loss."
